Don't forget to make all these scripts 'executable' by issuing a command:

chmod +x *.sh

on the folder that they are...


Also, 'myReboot.sh', like the command 'reboot', requires the privileges of the root user.

*next release will have a more consistent way to access the GPIO, the current way is too much simplistic...
